# WantedBoard
This simple system is used in any group to let members throw their questions/doubts and ask feedback from the management level.
(It is inspired by and similar with Google's Dory system.)

# How to use
1. Register an account
2. Login and throw a question/doubt.
3. One can second those topics thrown by others.
4. Management guys(with admin account) should reply the topics in the order of the seconded number.
5. One can accept(green light)/reject(red light) or stand no-comment for the replies.
